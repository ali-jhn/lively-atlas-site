I am a final-year B.Sc. student in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (GPA 3.96/4.0). My research centers on Large Language Models and NLP for low-resource Persian, including active learning for informal-to-formal text conversion and cross-lingual argument mining, where a bilingual XLM-RoBERTa lifted F1 from 50% to 75%. I also explore time-series modeling for predictive maintenance, proposing a wavelet-conditioned diffusion-Transformer for NASA C-MAPSS turbofan data, and I have earlier work in spectral graph theory. I have one journal article under review and another in preparation, presented at the 12th Graph Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics Conference, and served multiple times as a TA for AI, Operating Systems, Data Structures, and more. Ranked 134th in Iranâ€™s national entrance exam, Iâ€™m broadly interested in LLMs, NLP, IR, and ML, and Iâ€™m eager to pursue an MSc/PhD to advance reliable, data-efficient language technologies.
