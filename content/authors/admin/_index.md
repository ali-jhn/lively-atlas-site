I am a B.Sc. Computer Engineering student at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval, with a focus on data-efficient learning, robust evaluation, and building reliable language technologies for low-resource settings. I plan to continue this academic and research path through graduate study. Fun fact about me: I enjoy music, especially piano, and I also love playing football.
